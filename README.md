# Site Sections Wordpress plugin
## What
Plugin with one custom post type with a simple UI for people in a hurry.

## How
Download and install it in your main WP instance. Upon activation you can populate posts in a Custom Post Type next to your normal WP installation without it being visible in your theme pages.

Prefer to create a sub domain and install the Sveltekit-wp-theme there. [The theme]([https://kanot.com](https://github.com/Tdude/sveltekit-wp-theme)https://github.com/Tdude/sveltekit-wp-theme) will consume posts from you WP site's API once you configure your site's domain in src/services/WordPressService.js.

You can also run the theme locally but install this plugin to your WP site.
